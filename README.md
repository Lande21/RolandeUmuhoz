# Welcome to my GitHub ðŸ¤–!

My name is Rolande , I recently graduated with a Bachelor in Computer Science.
I realised my github was empty and i have a lot of projects that i worked on during my undergrad.

I am fond of the developer side of computer science.

Looking for any collaboration on mobile dev, front-end, back-end, full stack projects
